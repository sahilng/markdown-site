The idea here is to create a nonprofit organization that acts as a certifying body for open-education to decentralize the system of higher education.

Basically, how can we create a system that allows people to obtain certifications that can be leveraged for opportunity, without a static governing body.

For example, say there are some people that decide that a certain path of learning experiences should result in a given certification, they should be able to create a 'certificate' instance that represents the completion of that pathway.

That certificate, if explored by a questioning party, should show the path that is encapsulated. In other words, the validity and value of the certificate would be supported by the facts of the certificate itself (the learning pathway, who decided this pathway, etc) rather than the 'prestige' of a given institution.

The issue this aims to solve is that of over-centralization, inequality of access, and arbitrary validity of institutional certifications - all of which serves to further worsen the distribution of resources by amplifying the soical proof of those with power and access and providing a barrier to economic validity for those with the requisite skills but low access to prestige.

I think the open-source model makes sense here. The goal is not to further centralize things. Forks and branches and different communities with different values, all this makes sense. Perhaps that means that this is more of a protocol, or a suggested protocol - for open-certification.

What is the value of any centralization - or any nonprofit body - at all then? I'm not sure. I think, perhaps, it would be good to provide a connection to industry. So that people would pay the nonprofit for matching them to people (who have opted-in to this) for compensatory opportunities.

What is the right way to introduce an idea these days? Is incorporating (which we've already done) and forcing your way just furthering the distance from natural flow of human life? I don't know. Let's see where this project goes, as I work on it naturally, when I feel like I can do so healthily for myself and others.
